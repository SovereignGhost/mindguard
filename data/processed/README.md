# Processed Data

Train/validation/test splits ready for model evaluation.

## Splits:
- `train/`: 60% of data (for future fine-tuning experiments)
- `val/`: 20% of data (for hyperparameter tuning)
- `test/`: 20% of data (for final evaluation)

Each split maintains the balance between benign and poisoned samples.
